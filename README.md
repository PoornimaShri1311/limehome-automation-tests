## Limehome challenge - QA Engineer

We appreciate your time and effort in completing the task. We believe that this task will give you an opportunity to showcase your abilities and and will help us to gain a better understanding of your approach to testing.

We understand that your time is valuable, so we kindly request that you do not spend more than 3-4 hours on the challenge.


## Testing Challenge / Front End
Your task is to design and implement automated tests for the calculator located at http://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo/. The purpose of this task is to ensure that the calculator application functions as expected and meets the requirements. You should design a set of test cases to verify that the calculator functions correctly, and then write an automation script to execute those test cases.Your test cases should include a brief description of the test, the test data used, the expected result, and any relevant notes or comments.
You should provide a detailed test report, including the test cases executed, test results, and any issues encountered during the testing process.

## Testing Challenge / Back End
your task is to write a test suite for the API endpoint https://api.limehome.com/properties/v1/public/properties/129.


- Write a test case to verify that the API endpoint returns a 200 OK response status code. If the response status code is anything other than 200, the test should  fail.
- Write a test case to verify that the API endpoint returns the expected response body. The response body should contain details about the Limehome property with ID 129, including the property name, description, location, and other relevant details.



## What we check:
- Test coverage: Have you designed sufficient number of test cases to cover various scenarios?
- Test script quality: Is the automation script well-organized, easy to understand, and maintainable?
- Documentation: Did you document how to run your tests well? Is your written communication clear and easy-to-understand?

We expect you to send us a link to your code on Gitlab or Github.

### Technology:
We recommend Cypress, but you can use any testing methodology or tool that you prefer.
